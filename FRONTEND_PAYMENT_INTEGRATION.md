# Frontend PayPro Payment Integration

## Overview

The frontend has been updated to integrate with the PayPro hosted checkout flow. Instead of showing local payment forms, the application now redirects users to PayPro's secure payment page.

## Updated Flow

### 1. Checkout Process (Unchanged)
- User fills out customer information, shipping details, and selects payment method
- User clicks "Place Order" button
- Frontend creates order via backend API (`/orders/create/` or `/orders/create-direct/`)
- Frontend redirects to `/payment?order_id={order_id}`

### 2. Payment Initiation (Updated)
**File:** `frontend/src/app/payment/page.tsx`

- Automatically calls `initiatePayProPayment(orderId)` API
- Backend creates PayPro payment token and returns payment URL
- Frontend immediately redirects to PayPro hosted checkout: `window.location.href = paymentResponse.payment_url`

### 3. PayPro Hosted Checkout
- User completes payment on PayPro's secure platform
- PayPro redirects back to application based on payment result

### 4. Payment Callback Handling (Existing)
**File:** `frontend/src/app/order/payment-callback/page.tsx`

- Handles PayPro return callbacks at `/order/payment-callback`
- Processes payment status and updates order
- Redirects to success or failure pages

## Updated Files

### 1. Payment API (`frontend/src/lib/api/payment.ts`)
```typescript
// New function added:
export async function initiatePayProPayment(orderId: number, token?: string): Promise<{ payment_url: string }>
```

### 2. Payment Page (`frontend/src/app/payment/page.tsx`)
- Removed payment form components
- Added automatic PayPro payment initiation
- Shows loading screen with redirect steps
- Handles errors gracefully

### 3. Backend Integration
The frontend now calls these backend endpoints:
- `POST /api/v1/payments/initiate/` - Creates PayPro token and returns payment URL
- PayPro callbacks are handled by backend endpoints:
  - `/api/v1/payment/success/`
  - `/api/v1/payment/cancelled/` 
  - `/api/v1/payment/failed/`

## User Experience Flow

1. **Checkout Completion:**
   ```
   User clicks "Place Order" → Order created → Redirect to /payment?order_id=123
   ```

2. **Payment Redirect:**
   ```
   Payment page loads → Shows "Redirecting to secure payment..." → Automatic redirect to PayPro
   ```

3. **PayPro Payment:**
   ```
   User completes payment on PayPro platform
   ```

4. **Return to Site:**
   ```
   PayPro redirects → /order/payment-callback → Success/Failed page
   ```

## Key Benefits

1. **Security:** All payment processing handled by certified PayPro platform
2. **Compliance:** Reduces PCI compliance requirements
3. **User Trust:** Professional payment interface
4. **Maintenance:** No need to maintain local payment forms
5. **Features:** Access to PayPro's advanced payment features (installments, saved cards, etc.)

## Error Handling

- **Payment Initiation Errors:** User sees error message with option to return to checkout
- **PayPro Errors:** Handled by PayPro platform, user returned with error status
- **Callback Errors:** Processed by payment callback handler with appropriate user messaging

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Create an order through the checkout process
2. Verify redirect to PayPro payment page
3. Complete test payment on PayPro
4. Verify proper callback handling and order status updates
5. Test error scenarios (cancelled payments, failed payments)

## Configuration

Ensure these environment variables are set:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Backend API URL
- Backend PayPro credentials configured in Django settings

## Migration Notes

- Old payment forms are completely removed
- Payment session creation endpoints no longer needed
- All payment processing now handled via PayPro hosted checkout
- Existing order and callback handling remains unchanged
