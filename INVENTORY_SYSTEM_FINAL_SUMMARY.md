# Inventory Management System - Final Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of the inventory management system with comprehensive reservation cleanup and payment status monitoring.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Backend Inventory System
- **Enhanced Product Serialization** (`backend/products/serializers.py`)
  - Added inventory fields to `ProductVariantSerializer`
  - Includes: `stock_quantity`, `reserved_quantity`, `available_quantity`
  - Real-time availability calculations

### 2. Inventory API Endpoints (`backend/orders/api_views.py`)
- `POST /api/orders/check-stock/` - Check stock availability for multiple products
- `GET /api/orders/reservations/` - Get user's current reservations
- `POST /api/orders/bulk-stock-update/` - Admin bulk stock updates
- `GET /api/orders/inventory-dashboard/` - Admin dashboard data
- All endpoints include proper permission controls and validation

### 3. Frontend Integration
- **Inventory Service** (`frontend/src/services/inventoryService.ts`)
  - API integration functions for all inventory operations
  - Type-safe with proper error handling

- **React Components** (`frontend/src/components/inventory/`)
  - `StockStatusIndicator.tsx` - Visual stock status badges
  - `CartValidationAlert.tsx` - Cart validation with auto-fix capabilities
  - `InventoryDashboard.tsx` - Admin inventory management interface

- **Enhanced Product Card** (`frontend/src/components/ProductCard.tsx`)
  - Real-time stock status display
  - Dynamic quantity selectors based on availability
  - Stock warnings and out-of-stock handling

### 4. Cart and Checkout Integration
- **Cart Validation** - Real-time validation of cart items against stock
- **Auto-Fix Capabilities** - Automatically adjust quantities when stock changes
- **Checkout Guards** - Prevent checkout with invalid cart items
- **Reservation System** - 15-minute reservation timeout for pending orders

### 5. Automated Cleanup and Monitoring

#### Enhanced Management Commands

**`cleanup_expired_reservations.py`** - Comprehensive reservation cleanup:
- Cleans expired cart reservations (>15 minutes)
- Handles orphaned order reservations
- Processes payment status changes
- Automatic order cancellation for failed payments
- Detailed logging and reporting

**`check_pending_payments.py`** - Payment status monitoring:
- Integration with PayPro service for status checks
- Automatic order status updates based on payment results
- Reservation cleanup for failed/cancelled payments
- Orphaned reservation detection and cleanup
- Age-based order timeout handling
- Comprehensive reporting and dry-run capabilities

#### Monitoring and Automation Scripts

**Setup Scripts:**
- `scripts/setup-inventory-monitoring.sh` (Linux/macOS)
- `scripts/setup-inventory-monitoring.bat` (Windows)
- Automated cron/scheduled task setup
- Log file management
- Health checks and validation

**Monitoring Dashboard:**
- `scripts/monitoring-dashboard.py` - Real-time system status
- Inventory reservation overview
- Payment status analysis
- System health indicators
- Recent activity summary
- Actionable recommendations

## üîß Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Reservation Cleanup
**Problem Solved:** "For product variants with pending payments, the reserved quantity is recorded. However, there is no check to remove the reservation once the allotted time has expired."

**Solution:**
- Multi-phase cleanup process
- Time-based expiration (15 minutes)
- Payment status integration
- Orphaned reservation detection
- Automatic order cancellation

### 2. Payment Status Monitoring
**Problem Solved:** "Additionally, ensure that the payment status the order status is changing."

**Solution:**
- PayPro API integration for real-time status checks
- Automatic order status updates (paid/failed/cancelled)
- Reservation release for failed payments
- Comprehensive status tracking and logging

### 3. System Health Monitoring
**New Feature:** Proactive monitoring and alerting
- Health score calculation
- Performance metrics tracking
- Automated recommendations
- Early warning system for issues

## üìä Management Command Usage

### Daily Operations
```bash
# Quick cleanup (run every 15 minutes)
python manage.py cleanup_expired_reservations

# Payment monitoring (run hourly)
python manage.py check_pending_payments --cleanup-reservations

# Comprehensive monitoring (run twice daily)
python manage.py check_pending_payments \
  --cleanup-reservations \
  --check-orphaned-reservations \
  --max-age-hours 48 \
  --auto-timeout-hours 2
```

### Troubleshooting Commands
```bash
# Dry run to see what would be cleaned
python manage.py cleanup_expired_reservations --dry-run --verbose

# Force timeout old orders
python manage.py check_pending_payments --force-timeout --auto-timeout-hours 1

# Check for orphaned reservations
python manage.py check_pending_payments --check-orphaned-reservations --dry-run

# Detailed payment status check
python manage.py check_pending_payments --verbose --max-age-hours 72
```

### Monitoring Dashboard
```bash
# View current system status
python scripts/monitoring-dashboard.py
```

## üöÄ Automated Setup

### Linux/macOS
```bash
# Run setup script
chmod +x scripts/setup-inventory-monitoring.sh
./scripts/setup-inventory-monitoring.sh

# Follow displayed cron setup instructions
```

### Windows
```batch
# Run setup script
scripts\setup-inventory-monitoring.bat

# Follow displayed Task Scheduler setup instructions
```

## üìà Recommended Monitoring Schedule

### Production Environment
- **Every 5 minutes:** Cleanup expired reservations
- **Every 30 minutes:** Check payment statuses
- **Every 6 hours:** Comprehensive monitoring with orphan cleanup
- **Daily:** Review monitoring dashboard and logs

### Development Environment
- **Every 15 minutes:** Cleanup expired reservations
- **Hourly:** Check payment statuses
- **Twice daily:** Comprehensive monitoring

## üéØ Key Benefits Achieved
